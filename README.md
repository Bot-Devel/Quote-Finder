<h1 align="center">Quote Finder</h1>

This is a discord bot written in **Python** which searches a text file, in this case a Harry Potter fanfiction called **Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin**,using RegEx to find a quote and print out the line containing the quote as well as the next line in an embed message.
The bot's command prefix is `q.`
To use the bot, use `q.f QUOTE` and to read the Quick Doc, use `q.fhelp`
The quote is not case-sensitive so either uppercase, lowercase or combination of both can be used to search for the quote.
The following is an example on how the bot works in realtime-
