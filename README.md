This is a discord bot written in **Python** which searches a text file, in this case a Harry Potter fanfiction called **Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin** to find a quote and display the line containing the quote as well as the next line.
The bot's command prefix is `q.`
To use the bot, use `q.f QUOTE`
