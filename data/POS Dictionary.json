To keep a horcrux, you have to maintain a certain mindset constantly for the rest of your life and even after death. You must believe with absolute certainty that out of the entire human race, your life is the only one with any value. \n\nIn other words, \"If there is a single man, woman, or child in the entire world who you might refrain from brutally murdering in order to make a horcrux, then you would never be able to make a horcrux at all. Moreover, if something ever happened to cause you to feel that degree of empathy for anyoone else, any of your existing horcruxes would lose their soul-anchoring properties\"\n\nAfter creating a horcrux you also gain access to whatever magical properties the object originally had even if the object isn't in your possession. If he horcux gets destroyed you permanently gain whatever those powers were. "

So much, that you would see everyone left that you still cared about die along with you. \n\nHarry's and Regulus' fiendfyre flames take the shape of an enormous serpent and a wolf-like predator respectively. Described as daemonic antitheses of their patronuses. \n\nIt is not considered a unforgivable because there are Class XXXXX creatures who can only be harmed by Fiendfyre. If you've summoned Fiendfyre and your opponent kills you, its flames will run wild, destroying your assailant as revenge. Along with everything within a few miles. \nAdditionally, it can bend the Avada Kedavra by diverting it 3 degrees to the right from the point the curse strikes the hellfire. \n\nThe immediate aftereffects of Fiendfyre are highly toxic.
