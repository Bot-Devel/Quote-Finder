That destabilizes your soul in such a way that it allows you to shear off a portion of it and store it inside a prepared magical object.. To *keep* a horcrux, you have to maintain a certain mindset constantly for the rest of your life and even *after death*. You must believe with absolute certainty that out of the entire human race, your life is the only one with any value. \n\n\u2022 In Regulus' words, \"If there is a single man, woman, or child in the entire world who you might refrain from brutally murdering in order to make a horcrux, then you would never be able to make a horcrux at all. Moreover, if something ever happened to cause you to feel that degree of empathy for anyoone else, any of your existing horcruxes would lose their soul-anchoring properties\"\n\n\u2022 After creating a horcrux you also gain access to whatever magical properties the object originally had even if the object isn't in your possession.

They are comparable to the strength of a third-level Occlumens. \nLevel 1: **Perfect recall** and shields strong enough to keep out all but the best Legilimens if you practice often enough\nLevel 2: **Mastering your emotions.** Emotional suppression and clarity. Able to detect intrusions into your mind, and able to mount a consistent defense. \nLevel 3: **Understanding your emotions,** Recognizing when you are acting in response to emotional stimulus rather than rational decision-making. Thought stream partitioning, **Time dilation** (see `q.d 2`)\nLevel 4: **Memory palace**(s) (see `q.d 21`), **Advocatus diabolicus** (see `q.d 1`)\nLevel 5: Secondary personalities that bear up under Legilimency scrutiny\n\n__Esoteric Abilities/Extra Known Info:__\n \u2022 Being a **Natural Occlumens.** In which one wizard out of ten thousand gains the full benefits of Occlumency, the rarity is on par with being a natural Legilimens or a born Animagus. \n\u2022 Seven-stream thought arrays are common among DOM-trained Occlumens\n\u2022 Rookwood's 49-stream matrix allowed him to bring himself back from being Tabula Rasa'd (see `q.d 3`)\n\u2022 Occlumency traps to psychically and physically injure Legilimens that may be rooting around in your brain\n\u2022 A high-level Occlumens can fake a Veritaserum testimony, as they can alter their own memories.\n\n*Note: Being an animagus is completely unrelated with being an Occlumens, But it can provide a useful substitute. During the early phases of learning an animagus form, the wizard develops a dual-process mind. He simultaneously thinks as both human and an animal which provides a powerful defense against Legilimency.*"

Except that the Fool also tells me that you realized too late that achieving those goals might have been a terrible mistake. I suspect the fulfillment of an apocalyptic prophecy would fit that description.\"\n\n\"Turning to the immediate future, we have the *Wheel of Fortune inverted, Justice inverted, Strength, the Hanged Man, and the Lovers inverted*. A dangerous conflict draws near, one you will be drawn into unfairly and against your will. And while you will succeed in the challenges you face, even those successes may redound to the benefit of your enemies.\"\n\"You will also experience complications of a romantic nature which will threaten to distract you from more important concerns.\"\n\n\"Looking farther ahead, we find *the Devil, the Hierophant inverted, the Hermit inverted, and the Tower*. A great evil rising against you, likely the same Dark Wizard who will one day become a Dark God. Perhaps Voldemort, perhaps someone else. You must be prepared for either possibility. You will experience both the loss of a powerful guardian figure and a time of forced seclusion spent cut off from your allies and forced to rely solely on yourself. And ultimately, a time of destruction and catastrophe.\"\n\nFinally, she pointed to the last two cards. \"All of which lead to the end of your journey: *Death and Judgment.*\""

Nagini is not a normal snake and thus can be a viable horcrux host. She has been ... magically altered to be suitable as a horcrux.  Let's just leave it at that. I have plans for Nagini.
